# novaCord-site
This project is a website for an audio and music production company namely, Novacord. The site is designed as an example of a landing page for Novacord.

Novacord sell their services as composers and audio designers to create custom audio products for their clients such as jingles, game and film music.

The project used a combination of bootsrap, CSS and HTML to create a responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop making a website that bases its design on the company
logo, colours and theme. Novacord gave me feedback on my mockup design and this was the result of tweaks made with the clients interests in mind.
